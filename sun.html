            </P>
            <p>
            The Sun is an ulmost perfect sphere with a difference of diameter between the poles and the equator. The average radius of the sun is 695 (109.2 x that of the earth) of which 20-25% is the core.
            </p>
            <p>
            If a hollow sun was eaths filled up with spherical earths then around 960,00 would fit inside. On the other hand if these Earth were squished inside wasted space then aroung  then 1,300,000 would fit inside. The Sun's surface area is 0222 times that of the Earth's.
             </p>
